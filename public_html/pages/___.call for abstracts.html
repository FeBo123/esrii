      We open for abstract submission on January the 7th, 2019. Deadline for submission is March 18th, 2019 – don’t forget
      and save the date!
    </p>
    <p>
      All abstracts are welcome within the field of research on e-Mental Health. There are no pre-defined themes, so all
      submissions are very welcome. If you feel your submission is pushing the envelope, then feel free to contact us about
      it or convince us in the extra text with your submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abstract formats are 15-minute oral presentations and poster sessions (but no symposia). Please suggest which format of
      presentation you prefer with your submission. Please be aware, that we cannot guarantee you will get your preferred
      format, but we will do what we can. When all abstracts are submitted, they will be screened by the scientific
      committee and selected by an external expert panel. Final call will be made by the scientific committee. The conference
      program will be announced in April.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, we are trying something new this year. We are reserving one ‘wildcard’ super spot for an early career
      researcher. It will be a 15 minutes oral presentation in plenum, and it will be crowd-sourced through a Twitter vote.
      What this means is, that one lucky early career researcher will have the opportunity to speak to the whole conference
      about her or his research, and the community choose who! So, if you would like to be a candidate for the spot, all you
      need to do is to choose the ‘wildcard’ super spot as your preferred format of presentation. We then choose a maximum of five abstracts for the vote. If you want to participate in
      the voting process, just follow us on Twitter @ESRII2019CPH and vote and share! The winner will be contacted directly
      well in advance of the conference, so he or she will have good time to prepare.
