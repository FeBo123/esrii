<h1>About esrii</h1>

<p>
  The European Society for Research on Internet Interventions (<a href="http://esrii.org">esrii</a>) is an organization committed to advance research on e-health interventions.
</p>
<p>
  E-health interventions comprise existing and emerging technologies, including the Internet, mobile devices, digital gaming, virtual reality, remote sensing, and robotics. The mission of the organization is to foster excellence in evidence-based e-health interventions targeting behavioral and mental health.
</p>
<p>
  Every second-year esrii organizes a conference in Europe for researchers, clinicians, and policy experts. The last esrii conference was held in <a href="https://www.esrii2019.org/">Copenhagen, Denmark</a>, and had over 190 participants.
</p>
<p>
  In 2021, the Netherlands is hosting the esrii conference, which will be held from XX to XX in Amsterdam.
</p>
<p>
  There will be no conference fee, and we hope that many young researchers from all over Europe will participate!
