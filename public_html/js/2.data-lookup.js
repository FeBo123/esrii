    "Abstract": "Implementation of new interventions is problem everywhere, especially in LMI countries. The development of a new community mental health services in Kosovo still is characterized by considerable shortages, beside substantial effort on various levels. Obstacles remain financial and human resources; capacity building; stakeholder involvement and service availability. There is also a lack of strategies for promotion and prevention in mental health and lack of information systems, evidences and research for mental health. Recently (2016), the Mental Health Center in Prizren has joined an international consortium called ImpleMentAll, which is a project funded by the European Commission, Horizon 2020 with aim of developing, applying, and evaluating tailored implementation strategies for e-health interventions (ICBT) for depression. An exploratory, cross- sectional online survey (2017) found that e-psychotherapy can be potentially applied in Kosovo where acceptance of e-psychotherapy was reported between 35.5% ‘maybe’ and 50.2% ‘definitely’. however, this is rather counter intuitive to the responses about helpfulness of such therapies with just 17.5 % considering them definitely helpful and most of the sample (57.8 %) considering them as possibly helpful. Professionals in Kosovo / Albania in an online survey (2017) despite the small knowledge about e-psychotherapy, participants welcome this as an additional opportunity for the patients' benefit. Now the Albanian version of the iFightDepression tool is running at four Mental Health centers across Kosovo, but there are challenges to overcome regarding hesitations on the part of patients to use intervention as lack of PCs at home, fear of misuses of personal data, distrust as beneficial intervention vs. traditional biological treatment mode, stigma and no time."

    "Abstract": "Objectives\nMaking decisions about disclosing a mental illness in the workplace is complicated. Decision aid tools are designed to help an individual make a specific and deliberate choice. We developed the first web-based decision aid (READY) to help inform decisions about disclosure for employees. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of this tool, compared to the online information by a leading mental health charity.\nMethod\nA randomised controlled trial was conducted. Participants had access to the READY web-based decision aid tool or the active control for two weeks. Assessments occurred at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 weeks follow up.\nResults\nA total of 107 adult employees, average age 34 years, were randomised to READY (n=53) or the control arm (n=54). The sample was predominantly female (83.2%). Participants in READY showed greater reduction in decisional conflict at post-intervention (F(1,104) =16.8, p = <.001) (d=0.49, CI=0.1-0.9), and follow-up (F(1,104) =23.6, p = <.001) (d=0.61, CI=0.1-0.9) compared to the control arm. At post-intervention the READY group were at a later stage of decision making (F(1,104) =6.9, p=0.010) which was sustained, and showed a greater reduction in depression (F(1,104) =6.5, p=0.013) compared to the control group. Only those using READY made disclosures during the trial, a decision which was associated with an improvement in mental health.\nConclusions\nREADY provides a confidential, flexible, effective tool to enable employees to make an informed decision about disclosure options. READY is associated with an improvement in depressive symptoms. READY can allow employees to take control of their decision making in the workplace.\n"

    "Title": "Effectiveness of E-health interventions for reducing mental health conditions in employees: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
    "Abstract": "Background: Many workplaces are now promoting E-Health applications as a feasible, low cost method of addressing mental ill health and stress amongst employees. However, in spite of their popularity, the efficacy of these work-based E-Health interventions is unknown. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the evidence for their effectiveness.\nMethods: Systematic searches were conducted using MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CENTRAL and EMBASE for relevant articles published from Jan 1, 2004 until November 17, 2016, evaluating an E-Health based intervention focused on the mental health of employees in a trial. The quality of all identified studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. We extracted means and standard deviations from published reports, comparing the difference in effect sizes in standardized mental health outcomes. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model stratified by the length of follow up, type of intervention and whether the intervention was universal (unselected) or targeted to selected groups e.g. “stressed”.\nResults: 24 trials were identified. 11 interventions were Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) based, 6 involved Stress Management, and 7 were Mindfulness based. CBT interventions delivered universally showed a small positive effect at both post-intervention (g=0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.29) and follow up (g= 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.30), but no overall effect for selected employees. Mindfulness interventions delivered universally to employees showed a moderate, but unsustained, improvement at post-intervention (g=0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.72). Targeted stress management showed a large effect size at post-intervention (g=0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.09) and follow-up (g= 0.77, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.51). \nInterpretation: There is limited evidence that some E-Health interventions (CBT and Mindfulness-based) universally delivered to employees may reduce mental ill-health and stress, though these effects were not seen when targeted at selected or symptomatic employees.  Although stress management interventions appear to have benefits when focused on those complaining of increased stress levels they had no positive outcome in unselected employees. Despite the enthusiasm in the corporate world for such approaches, employers and other organisations should be aware that they may not be without risk, and achieving good outcomes depends of the right type of intervention being delivered to the correct population.\n"

    "Title": "Effectiveness, acceptability, and safety of Internet-delivered psychological therapies for somatoform disorders and functional somatic syndromes: a narrative overview and recommendations for future research",
    "Abstract": "Somatoform disorders and associated functional somatic syndromes (FSS) are among the most common mental disorders in Europe. However, despite high prevalence and comorbidity with other mental disorders, patients rarely access traditional psychotherapeutic care. Reasons include structural barriers (e.g. healthcare resources, treatment allocation), somatic-dominated health models or unfavorable treatment expectations. Thus, Internet-or mobile-delivered psychological interventions (IMIs) may represent low threshold and effective instruments in somatoform and related disorders. This narrative overview summarizes the literature on the effectiveness, acceptability, and safety of IMIs in this field of research. \nFor a broad spectrum of somatoform disorders, meta-analytic evidence shows small to medium pooled effect sizes for IMIs regarding symptom severity, which is comparable to the range of effects found in traditional psychotherapeutic (or pharmacological) interventions. The evidence is weaker for long-term effects and comparisons with active control conditions. Most studies target chronic pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia. Further research is needed in hypochondriasis, somatization- or conversion disorder and FSS such as chronic fatigue syndrome. Only two, yet promising, studies investigating IMIs for somatoform disorders in adolescents could be found. Most IMIs are CBT-based stand-alone interventions and include at least minimal human guidance, whereas studies investigating unguided or mobile-delivered interventions, in stepped- or blended care contexts, as well as naturalistic and non-inferiority designs, are scarce. The literature suggests intervention- (e.g. level of professionalism of guidance, use of exposure) or participant-related moderators of effectiveness. Attrition rates vary across somatoform disorders but seem to be lower than in trials for affective or anxiety disorders. Only a few studies report side effects (symptom deterioration) with no evidence for serious critical events. Evidence for cost-effectiveness is limited and shows mixed results. Strategies for future research and implementation efforts, that make IMIs impactful in unreached target groups, will be outlined. "

Sharing research findings with the general public is very important but can be difficult to get right; we want to explore what people will actually find useful and engaging.\n\nMethods: Participants (patients, carers, health researchers) will be recruited to take part in a workshop which will be informed by principles of patient and public involvement and use Collective Intelligence (CI) research methods. This format will enable the group to combine knowledge, share insights, and generate possible solutions to how research findings could be shared with the general public and in what format. For example, would participants prefer copies of published papers, lay summaries, posters, videos with case stories or animations? How much detail do they want? \n\nResults: A multi-format digital media resource on how best to disseminate research findings to health service users, research participants and members of the public will be created based on perspectives shared in the workshop. Participants will be invited to remain involved throughout the resource development, design and feedback stages.\n\nConclusion: There is an increasing emphasis on involving patients, participants and the general public in all stages of research. It is anticipated that this resource could become an effective and straightforward template on how best to share knowledge/findings for both the CPR team and other health researchers.\n"

    "Title": "Development of an internet Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy (iABCT)",
    "Abstract": "Compassion refers to a multidimensional psychological construct that involves the feeling that arises in presence of another’s suffering and implies the desire to help. There is a growing number of studies pointing out the benefits of Compassion-based Interventions (CBI) and their association to psychological health. CBI are focused on training compassion to others and/or towards oneself (self-compassion) employing formal and informal meditation practices. Recent scientific literature is emerging to prove the feasibility and efficacy of cultivating compassion over the Internet and, thus, delivering self-applied online CBI. The aim of the present work is to introduce and explain the development of an internet Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy (iABCT), the first CBI in Spain, that will be tested in a feasibility trial. ABCT is an intervention protocol of compassion based on attachment theory and includes practices to raise awareness and/or address maladaptive aspects of attachment styles developed with parents. The online version (iABCT) is developed to be totally self-applied via the Internet through the website www.psicologiaytecnologia.com designed by Labpsitec. The iABCT consist of eight sequential modules: 0) Welcome module: approaching to the compassion; 1) Preparing ourselves for compassion: Kind attention; 2) Discovering our compassionate world; 3) Developing our compassionate world; 4) Understanding our relationship with compassion; 5) Working on ourselves; 6) Understanding the importance of forgiveness; and 7) Consolidating the practice of compassion. Each module follows the same structure: module agenda; theoretical contents of the module; exercises and activities (including formal and informal practices); assessment of the knowledge acquired during the module; homework assignments between modules; and summary of the module. The program includes the use of texts, audios, videos, pictures, vignettes, and interactive exercises. Formal meditations are delivered through audios with specific instructions. Each participant is free to advance at his/her own pace, although they are advised to perform one module per week, taking days between sessions to complete homework assignments. The internet-based intervention can be completed in eight weeks, with a maximum period of ten weeks. The iABCT is currently being developed and adapted to include usable and well-accepted content that have been shown efficacious in previous clinical trials. "

    "Abstract": "Objective: To examine the effectiveness of an adjunctive Internet intervention for depression in a large sample of psychotherapeutic routine care patients. \nMethod: The present study evaluates a subgroup of patients from the EVIDENT trial, a randomized assessor-blinded investigation on the treatment of mild to moderate depression. 392 adults (mean age = 43.3 years; 69.9% female) of the original sample received psychiatric or psychotherapeutic outpatient psychotherapy at the time of randomization to a 12-week minimally supported Internet intervention (Deprexis). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, three months (post) and six months (follow-up).\nResults: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that combined treatment led to greater reduction in self-reported and clinician-rated symptoms of depression (effect sizes d = 0.26 – 0.44), and higher mental health-related quality of life. There was no effect on physical-related quality of life. The same pattern, with diminished treatment effects (d = 0.23 – 0.34), was found at 6-month follow-up. Except baseline depressiveness, demographic and clinical variables did not predict outcomes of combined treatment. Online engagement was higher in more severely depressed and in older patients.\nConclusion: Results indicate that the adjunctive use of Internet interventions can produce additional and lasting effects in routine outpatient psychotherapy. The study adds to the ongoing evidence from superiority trials in integrated blended therapy. Future studies should investigate different types of blends in diverse populations."

    "Title": "Effects of intense assessment on statistical power in randomized controlled trials:\nInformed simulation study on depression",
    "Abstract": "Clinical trials are mainly based on single point assessments of psychopathology. At the same time, automatized repeated assessments based on short scales are an increasing practice to account for daily fluctuations in disease symptoms (e.g. ecological momentary assessment, or time series-based analyses). This study investigated the impact of Intense Pre-Post-Assessment (IPA) on statistical\npower in randomized controlled trials. A simulation study, based on three scenarios and several data sets, estimated the expected power gains of two- or fivefold pre-post-measurements of fluctuating disease symptoms. For each condition, 62.000 data sets were generated and AN(C)OVAs were applied to randomly drawn subsamples (N=50 – N=200) of these data sets. An improved signal-to-noise ratio increased power beyond standard methods. Power increases ranged from 6% to 92%, with higher gains in more underpowered scenarios. ANCOVA with baseline as covariate profited from a more\nprecise estimation of the baseline covariate, resulting in additional gains in statistical power. Ecological momentary assessment-like data sources (with low autocorrelation) resulted in highest absolute statistical power and outperformed traditional single point assessments. Comparable results emerged in complementing analyses for non-parametric (bootstrap permutation test) and linear mixed models (LMM). IPA integrates short time series-based assessments into clinical research designs and\nit accounts for natural fluctuations in daily disease symptoms. Sensitivity and efficiency of current RCTs can be improved by implementing a low number of automatized repeated assessments. Therefore, the investigated method might be a useful alternative to traditional point assessments (e.g. in neuroscience, or drug and psychotherapy research). Results are based on diverse simulations, implying high statistical validity. However, more empirical evidence is needed. For example, effects\nmay diverge for psychiatric conditions with more complex symptom dynamics (e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder)."

    "Abstract": "Background: The boom in the production of digital health interventions for the assessment and management of severe mental health problems has led to numerous large-scale trials currently being conducted worldwide. However, despite growing interest in the field of digital mental health, implementation within mental health service settings is still in its relative infancy. In order to understand how best to implement digital health interventions it is important to identify relevant stakeholder views towards such delivery options. However, there is currently a lack of research identifying individual perceptions about digital mental health. \nAims: For several years, our digital mental health group have been exploring views towards digital health interventions designed specifically for severe mental health problems such as psychosis and bipolar disorder. In this presentation, we aim to summarise our key findings from our ongoing qualitative work in the field. \nMethods: We have combined the findings from four qualitative studies conducted in the North West of England to identify common themes regarding stakeholder views towards the implementation of digital health interventions. The first two studies were focus groups involving 68 staff working in secondary care mental health services. The second two studies were one-to-one interviews with 39 service users experiencing psychosis or bipolar disorder. Data were analysed thematically using NVivo (version 10) software and involved rigorous reliability checks including triangulation and member checking. \nResults: Data could be categorised within three overarching themes regarding implementation: i) service and staff-related barriers and facilitators; ii) service user-related barriers and facilitators; and iii) technology-related barriers and facilitators. Within each theme, multiple subthemes were identified, including: i) staff training and expertise; ii) the digital divide; and iii) privacy and safety fears. \nConclusion: In this presentation we identify several key recommendations for researchers and clinicians developing digital tools for this population. Recommendations include, but are not limited to, decisions underlying technology ownership and skills; ethical considerations for the use and sharing of data received from devices; integration of digital health interventions within face-to-face delivery settings; and common features stakeholders believe to be important in future digital health interventions. \n"

    "Title": "An Internet-based Self-Applied Treatment Program for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD): Study Protocol for an Open Clinical Trial",
    "Abstract": "Approximately 10% of the individuals experiencing the death of a loved one develop prolonged grief disorder (PGD) after bereavement. There are cognitive-behavioural treatments (CBT) that have shown efficacy in reducing symptoms characteristic of PGD but this does not ensure that people who need treatment can access to it. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the dissemination of treatments to reach more people. Systematic reviews have shown that Internet-based interventions are efficacious, and meta-analyses studies have also shown that these interventions produce greater effect sizes compared to the control group and the same size as traditional face-to-face protocols. This work presents the protocol study describing the plan to conduct an open clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of an Internet-based Intervention for PGD compared to the traditional face-to-face Intervention. A minimum of 24 participants will be randomly assigned to two treatment conditions for PGD: 1) Internet-based intervention 2) traditional face-to-face intervention. The diagnostic interview for the PGD of Prigerson y Jacobs (2001) will be applied. Four moments of evaluation will be included: pre-treatment, post-treatment and two follow-up periods (3- and 12-month). Both interventions will have the same main therapeutic components: integration and restoration of lost, reconstruction meaning loss and establishment of durable bound with the deceased. Internet-based treatment will be developed in a specialized web platform (www.psicologiaytecnologia.com). Online intervention will include videos, vignettes, audios and interactive exercises and patients will receive a weekly support call of maximum 10 minutes. This work is currently in progress and the study is in process of registration at clinicaltrials.gov. The present study aims to improve knowledge about the effectiveness of an intervention for PGD, and conduct a preliminary comparison between two intervention conditions (Internet based intervention vs. traditional face-to-face intervention). We expect to provide preliminary data regarding efficacy of this internet-based intervention. Also, we pretend to collect information that can help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Internet based interventions. Additionally, to our knowledge, this will be the first internet-based intervention for PGD in Spanish language.

SDM appears to occur less frequently in mental health care than in primary care. Electronic aids developed to support SDM might be a promising mean to engage patients in their mental healthcare and support recovery. \nObjectives: The aim of the trial is to investigate the effects of using a smartphone app (Momentum) to promote patient activation and support SDM for people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.\nMethods: The participants in the study are 1:1 randomised to an intervention group (Momentum app and TAU) or a control group (TAU alone). 260 people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizotypal or delusional disorder are recruited from outpatient treatment settings in Denmark. The intervention last 6 months with data collection at three time-points. Primary outcome is patient activation. Secondary outcomes are perceived efficacy in patient-provider interaction, working alliance, symptoms, level of functioning; self-efficacy; treatment satisfaction and hope. Patients’ satisfaction and experience regarding the usefulness of the app are explored.\nDiscussion: The study investigates the efficacy of using a smartphone application in terms of supporting SDM interactions between people with schizophrenia and their healthcare providers. Based on the results, available in 2021, the study contributes with more knowledge about to which degree the use of digital healthcare solutions may support SDM, patient activation and a recovery-oriented treatment approach in mental health care.\n"

    "Abstract": "Technical /Scientific background: Exposure therapy has been shown to be effective in treating Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), especially when it is part of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). However, exposure therapy for SAD can be costly to structure logistically, and troublesome to control and graduate. In addition, many clients with SAD are so fearful that they will avoid treatment when they must face feared situations in-vivo. \nVirtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) might enable us to circumvent some of these problems, by making it possible to expose patients to their feared situations in the therapy room via Virtual Reality (VR) equipment. \n\nKey features of the technology presented: Five 360 degree VR films has been shot and edited to be used in VRET for SAD. Each film depicts a typical social anxiety inducing situation and consists of four to five scenes of approx. 2 minutes length, which allows the therapist to graduate the exposure.\nThe films are played on an Occulus Go connected to high quality headphones. The Occulus Go places a screen in front of the users face which almost fully takes up their field of view, while simultaneously blocking out visual sensory input from the real world. Motion detectors in the Occulus Go allows the user to look around the films as they play in 360 degrees around them.\nTo maximize ease of use for both the client and the therapist, an app for the Occulus Go has been developed which allows the user to choose the scenes they wish to see in an intuitive and simple interface. \nThe technical demonstration will give a brief overview of the equipment and its intended use and then allow attenders to try the Occulus Go and see the films themselves.\n\nImplications for everyday clinical practice of CBT: CBT augmented with VRET for SAD might increase therapy adherence, increase user acceptance of exposure therapy, reduces risk of confidentiality breaches and reduce costs associated with transport and timing (e.g. going to the supermarket in the early or late hours as an early exposure step). \n"

    "Abstract": "Real-time monitoring using mobile phones within the field of suicide prevention can help better understand the dynamics of suicidal ideation (SI), even from hour to hour. By applying a class of novel methodological techniques called network analysis to ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data, we quantified and visualized both a temporal and contemporaneous within-persons network and a between persons network. These networks allows us generate hypothesis on the potential causal relations between suicide ideation and several risk factors.\nSeventy-four inpatients with a Major depression and SI assessed their momentary SI, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, hopelessness, depression, anxiety, and positive affect ten times a day for a period of six days using a mobile phone. A lag-1 temporal network was estimated via multi-level vector autoregression (mlVAR) modelling.  Using the covariance matrix of the  stationary means, a between subject network was estimated. Finally, a contemporaneous network was presented by visualizing the partial associations between the residuals of temporal and the between subject multilevel models.\nThe temporal network revealed that SI was only associated with SI and perceived burdensomeness at the previous time point. SI at the previous time point was associated with perceived burdensomeness, hopelessness, depression, and positive affect at the next time point. Within the contemporaneous network, SI was most strongly related to hopelessness, but also to all other variables. Between subject network revealed that patients with higher average SI scores, tended to also present  higher average hopelessness scores.\nThese findings are in line with other studies using ecological momentary assessment. First, suicidal thoughts seem to be reinforcing given that they predict themselves over time. Second, the well-known risk factors for suicide ideation were associated with higher levels of suicide ideation at the moment, but not over time.  This indicates that the dynamics of suicide ideation is different than previously assumed. \n Network analysis of EMA data extends more traditional multilevel analysis by offering a visualization of the relation between all variables, and an insight on both the within and between subjects effects "

Results indicate that internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) could reduce social anxiety symptoms but findings from previous trials indicate that interventions with limited therapist support might not be enough for youth to implement the treatment principles in their everyday life. The primary aim of the current trial was to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of therapist-guided ICBT for youth with SAD.\nMethod: This was a single-blind randomized controlled trial comparing therapist-guided ICBT with therapist-guided internet-delivered support and counseling (ISUPPORT) for children and adolescents (N = 103; 10-17 y) with a principal diagnosis of SAD. Both treatments included weekly contact with a therapist and were supplemented with three individual videoconference sessions. Participants randomized to the active treatment arm received CBT for 10 weeks. Participants randomized to the control condition received 10 weeks of ISUPPORT and were then offered ICBT for 10 weeks, after the 3-month follow-up. Primary endpoint was the 3-month follow-up assessment. Clinicians blind to treatment allocation conducted assessments post treatment as well as the 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician Severity Rating (CSR), derived from the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule for DSM-IV, child version (ADIS-C). Secondary outcome measures included self- and parent rated measures of social anxiety (LSAS-CA), level of functioning (EWSAS) as well as maintaining factors such as anticipatory anxiety (ASBQ), post-event processing (PEPQ) and self-focus (FAQ). Data was also collected on numerous aspects of health related costs.  \nResults: Results will be presented as between-group effect sizes from pre to the 3-month follow-up. In addition, results will include evaluation of cost-effectiveness of ICBT for youth with SAD. We hypothesize that ICBT will be more efficacious in reducing symptoms of social anxiety compared to ISUPPORT, as well as being more cost-effective.\nDiscussion: The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ICBT for children and adolescents with SAD will be discussed."

    "Title": "Optimising engagement with app-based alcohol interventions: Results from a randomised controlled trial evaluation of the BRANCH app targeting harmful drinking in young adults",
    "Abstract": "Context\nElectronic screening and brief intervention (eSBI) has demonstrated some effectiveness in reducing harmful alcohol consumption. However, a challenge remains as to how to sufficiently engage users with app-based eSBI, as trials demonstrate low engagement rates. Increased engagement has been associated with improved clinical outcomes in both the alcohol and broader behavior change literature. Identifying novel methods to engage users is needed to improve the effectiveness of app-based eSBI interventions. \n\nMethods\nParticipants were recruited through Facebook and screened and consented via an online tool. Inclusion criteria was: 18-30 years old, drinking harmfully (AUDIT-C score>7) and UK-based. Participants were randomised to an eSBI only or eSBI plus Engagement Promoting Strategies (EPS) version of the BRANCH app. Number of logins was measured at 28 days post-randomisation. Change in drinking was measured by the AUDIT-C score at baseline and 6-month follow-up. \n\nIntervention \nBRANCH included: A drinking diary, personalised feedback, goal setting functions for alcohol reduction and information on risks. It was also optimised for engagement including: Tailoring, reminders, a Twitter style newsfeed and gamification features.\n\nResults\n569 participants were recruited. There were no main effects of change in logins between arms. Users of the eSBI plus EPS app did not show a significant reduction in harmful drinking score as measured by the AUDIT-C score compared to users of the eSBI only app, nor did engagers who logged into BRANCH more than once show a significant reduction in harmful drinking compared to non-engagers (logged in once).\n\nConclusions\nEngagement with eSBI in young adults continues to be a barrier for designing effective eSBI apps. The associations between EPSs, engagement and drinking outcomes remain unclear. The low engagement rates with eSBI apps may be due to a lack of exposure to the active behaviour change components, resulting in limited effects. Researchers and developers need to consider the balance between the intensity of the eSBI intervention and high levels of user burden which subsequently promotes disengagement. \n"

    "Abstract": "Eating disorders are rare and there are few specialized health professionals. Traditional trainings are tied to a certain time and place, and often do not focus on nutrition management. To expand training opportunities, we have developed a scalable web-based training for health professionals (clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, dieticians). The training consists of eleven units (personal nutrition ideals, intuitive eating, nutrition research, nutrition 101, psychoeducation, binge eating and compensatory behaviors, under- and overweight patients, dietary restraint and avoidance, working with food logs, difficult situations during treatment). We evaluated the feasibility of our training in an uncontrolled pre-post design. \nWe assessed characteristics of the participants (e.g., professional training, professional experience, motivation for participating), usage of the training, usability, user feedback and changes in treatment knowledge, disorder specific therapeutic competencies and expectations toward working with patients with eating disorders.\n117 participants completed the baseline assessment, of which 73 signed up for the training, 32 completed all eleven units and 31 completed the post-training assessment. We observed considerable gains in treatment knowledge (d = 1.96), disorder specific therapeutic competencies (d = 0.94) and as well as positive expectations toward working with patients with eating disorders (d = .89).\nOur findings support the feasibility of web-based trainings. More research is needed to examine effects in comparison with traditional training modalities (e.g., group training) and the application of knowledge in clinical practice. \n"

    "Abstract": "Background: Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) has been developed as an accessible and cost-effective treatment option for children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the question regarding how the treatment could optimally be implemented to be of most benefit for both patients and health care providers remained unanswered. \nMethod: A multicenter, randomized controlled non-inferiority trial for children and adolescents with OCD. The primary aim is to evaluate if ICBT can be delivered in a stepped care model without sacrificing efficacy and thus resulting in resource savings. Participants (N=152) are recruited from two specialist OCD clinics in Stockholm and Gothenburg and through online self-referral. Participants are randomized to either a stepped care ICBT group receiving ICBT for 16 weeks, or to a gold standard group receiving face-to-face cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for 16 weeks. After the 3-month follow-up, participants who are classified as non-responders in both groups are offered additional face-to-face CBT before the 6-month follow-up. Blind assessments are administered at baseline, post-treatment, 3-month and 6-month follow-up. At 6-month follow-up (primary endpoint), we will test non-inferiority and compare resource use between the stepped care ICBT group and gold standard group. The non-inferiority margin is set to 4 points on the primary outcome measure (Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale). Long-term effects will be investigated one, two and five years after treatment completion. \nResults: Trial protocol will be presented. Recruitment started in October 2017, and is anticipated to be finished by June 2019. Results from the primary endpoint will is anticipated to be available June 2020. \nDiscussion: If the stepped care model is non-inferior to gold standard treatment, it will increase the availability to treatment and provide children and adolescents an opportunity to receive an early intervention for OCD."

    "Title": "Reducing coercion in in-patient psychiatry using Virtual Reality: A pilot project evaluation",
    "Abstract": "Introduction: Coercion is a contentious subject in mental health services. Psychiatric patients in Denmark are at risk of being subjected to manual restraint, mechanical restraint or involuntary sedation during aggressive episodes or comparable circumstances of disinhibition. A variety of research has shown coercion to have a negative impact on both staff and patients. In response Denmark is one of several countries that have increased their focus on reducing coercion in the in-patient mental health services. In the Region of Southern Denmark, the effort has been based on several approaches including the Six Core Strategies from NASMHPD and the Safewards model. Prior interventions have shown good effect, but a group of in-patients has continued to show elevated risks of being subjected to coercion. This patient group consists of young in-patients as well as patients suffering from substance use disorders. The present study is an evaluation of a pilot project that aims at reducing the use of coercions through implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) for recreational purposes in six in-patient psychiatric wards in Odense. VR was chosen in order to appeal to the younger patient group. The aim was to utilize the immersive and pleasing qualities of VR for recreation, and perhaps decrease the feeling of being locked in an institution as well as allowing for distraction from the experience of confinement.\n\nMethod: The study will use a mixed methods design focusing on thematic analysis in the first part of the study, and utilize a quantitative analysis in the second part. Data will be gathered from a variety of sources. Semi-structured interviews will be performed with both patients (N = 7) and staff (N = 8) at a closed ward in the Mental Health Services of Southern Denmark for the purpose of thematic analysis. Together with the Systems Usability Scale, the thematic analysis will shed light on the user experiences and usability of VR in a psychiatric ward. Furthermore, data will be gathered retrospectively from three different wards with beds in secluded areas regarding the amount of coercion used from 2016 throughout 2018, where VR was implemented during 2018. Data will be handled as a non-randomized cluster trial where different units function as control cases for each other, as VR was implemented at different times in each unit. The qualitative analysis will be used to inform the quantitative analysis if possible.\n\nResults: will be analyzed and discussed."

    "Abstract": "Context: An internet intervention to treat individuals with Internet Use Disorder (IUD) appears contradictive at first. But an easily accessible and attractive treatment option is crucial as the target group is characterized by low levels of treatment motivation.\nIUD is emerging as an increasing societal concern as it is associated with reduced quality of life and mental health comorbidities such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety. Evidence-based treatment options are, however, scarce due to the novelty of the diagnosis. Internet interventions may be an effective means to deliver psychological treatment to individuals with IUD as they address individuals affected in their online setting. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a newly developed, guided internet intervention for IUD.\nMethods: In a two-armed randomized controlled trial (N = 130), individuals showing problematic internet use patterns (Internet Addiction Test ≥ 49) will be randomly allocated to the internet intervention or a Waiting Control Group. Assessments will take place at baseline, 7 weeks, 6- and 12 months after randomization. The primary outcome is internet addiction (IAT). Secondary outcomes include quality of life, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and other psychosocial variables associated with IUD.\nIntervention: The intervention consists of seven sessions: Goal setting and motivational interviewing, impulse control, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, self-worth, relapse prevention and a booster session. Participants are supported by an eCoach who provides individual feedback after completion of each session. Participants can choose between several elective sessions based on individual need and opt to receive motivational messages and exercises via app.\nResults: Sample characteristics and preliminary results will be presented.\nConclusions: This is the first study to evaluate an internet intervention for IUD, which could be a promising first step to reduce individuals’ disease burden.\n"

    "Abstract": "Loneliness has been described as a growing problem in many parts of the world that at a basic level stems from an unwanted discrepancy between the actual and desired social situation. Though often a source of suffering and distress in and of itself, studies have also linked the phenomenon to a wide range of psychiatric and somatic problems. Previous research on interventions targeting loneliness, though scarce, have indicated the potential for psychological treatment to be an efficacious way of helping this population. The current study investigated the efficacy of two nine-week internet-based treatments: one based on cognitive behavioral therapy and one based on interpersonal psychotherapy. Both were compared to a wait-list control group. A total of 116 participants were recruited for the study and randomized to one of the three conditions. Standardized measures of loneliness, depression, social anxiety, quality of life, and worry will be administered at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up and analyzed using a multilevel model framework. The results from the trial will be presented for the first time at ESRII 2019. "

    "Abstract": "Introduction:\nThe prevalence of personality disorders (PDS) in the general population is estimated at 13.5 %\nand amongst patients with psychiatric illness it is 60.4 % . Online treatments for personality disorders have not been developed yet. Group psychotherapy has proven to be as effective in treating PDS as individual psychotherapy, but has proven to be more cost effective. An effective online group therapy for PDS could prove a valuable addition to the treatment possibility’s for this patient group. This study aims to  provide an overview of technical and clinical possibilities, as well as the evidence base for online group therapy, this to inform health professionals about the activity in this field of research and to serve as a basis for conducting further research in this field. \nMethod: \nBecause of the large variety and possibility of conducting online group therapy (chat, video, telephone) we conducted a systematic scoping review. \nSystematically we searched for online group therapy in all different fields of psychiatric disorders such as mood, anxiety, psychotic, substance abuse and autism spectrum disorders. Searches were conducted in psychology and medical science data basis. Studies were included if they provided primary research data on a form of  online group therapy. \nResults:\nThe searches conducted yielded 4082 articles which were analyzed and reduced to a number of articles that specifically provided data on online group therapy. \nConclusion: \nOnline group therapy has been tested and given through telephone, chat and recently videoconferencing technology. The nature of this group therapy (group dynamics, group therapy factors that contribute to healing such as catharsis) was similar to face to face group therapy. The measured effect of online group therapy proved comparably to the effect of f2f group therapy. This study supports the idea that online group therapy through videoconferencing could be a feasible treatment for patients with PDS. \n"

    "Title": "Learn from our history – the use of machine learning to predict treatment outcome for Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy",
    "Abstract": "Empirical support for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for a range of psychiatric conditions has shown to be extensively robust. Despite this around 30-60% of those who receive CBT do not remit after treatment. This raises the issue of prediction - If one could identity these individuals in an early stage the opportunity to adapt treatment in line with the patient’s trajectory could improve results. Although attempts at prediction have been made many have eventuated to ad-hoc explaining outcome rather than predicting. \n\nA field which has been dedicated to prediction and has recently risen to prominence due to its success is the field of machine learning. Machine learning, which can briefly be stated to be a field of study in the conjunction of statistics, computer science and the study of algorithms, is mainly concerned with building algorithms which learns (based on data) to be useful for some specific task, for example predicting treatment outcome. \n\nAs the use of machine learning has grown in recognition it has already been investigated in some studies pertaining to psychological treatments. However, no study, to our knowledge, has gathered all the data used during psychological treatment in a large dataset of patients to investigate the predictive possibilities of using machine learning with a broad spectrum of clinical data. Thus, results from various machine learning methods in predicting treatment outcome in a sample of over 5000 patients in routine care which has undergone Internet-based CBT treatment for major depression, panic disorder and social anxiety disorder will be presented. \n\nThe algorithms will use data (e.g. symptom measures, messages between therapist and patient, reported activities) from baseline up until week 4 in the treatment. Various methods will be tried and presented, foremost using supervised machine learning, such as case-based methods (e.g. k-Nearest Neighbour), logical methods (e.g. random forest), neural networks (e.g. multilayer perceptrons), statistical-learning methods (e.g. Hidden Markov models) and heuristic models such as reinforcement learning. \n\nThus, in this presentation I will present the results of using machine learning based on data collected at baseline and up to week 4 in treatment to predict the final treatment result in a sample of over 5000 patients in routine internet-based CBT care.

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Anxiety is a burden for many adolescents in Sweden today. Yet there is still a lack of access to effective care for the youths in need. Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) is a treatment format with the potential to increase accessibility of evidence-based care. The efficacy of ICBT in adolescents are promising but little is known about how ICBT should be adapted and delivered in the best possible way for this population. Thus, the overall aim of this study was to examine the effect of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for adolescents with clinically significant anxiety. More specifically, the aim was to evaluate the additive effects of learning support and therapeutic guidance through chat-sessions on treatment outcome.\nMethod: Using a two‐by‐two factorial design, a total of 120 adolescents were randomized to one of four different intervention groups: 1) ICBT with therapeutic guidance through mail. 2) ICBT with therapeutic guidance through chat. 3) ICBT with learning support and therapeutic guidance through mail. 4) ICBT with learning support and therapeutic guidance through chat. The treatment had a transdiagnostic approach and went on for eight weeks.\nResults: Overall, the treatment had a significant effect on all outcome measures. Mainly, the results revealed reduced symptoms on the two primary outcome measures (BAI, d = 0.75, BDI, d = 1.04). The analyses showed mixed results regarding the effect of the two independent variables on treatment outcome. An significant effect of learning support was found on the primary outcome measures (BAI, d = .41; BDI d = 0.37). Adding chat-sessions with a therapist, however, did not affect the main outcomes. Analyses on secondary outcomes showed a significant effect of learning support on knowledge acquisition (d = 0.49) and a significant effect of chat was found on self-esteem (d = 0.38). \nConclusion: These results show that ICBT can reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents. By being one of the first studies to examine the relative effect of different components in ICBT for adolescents, this study primarily highlights the potential of learning support to enhance the effects of ICBT on treatment outcome. \n"

Psychometric analysis of candidate items were done with participants from the Internet Psychiatry Clinic (n=5103) and the REGASSA study (n=317). Six criteria related to factor structure, sensitivity to change and clinical representativeness were used to select items. A proposed weekly battery of very brief scales were then tested for feasibility in a small sample of patients receiving internet-based treatment at the Internet Psychiatry Clinic (n=8).\nResults: Existing very brief scales were used for depression (PHQ-2), generalized anxiety (GAD-2) and social anxiety (mini-SPIN) together with evaluated candidate items from full scales measuring panic and agoraphobia (PDSS-SR), stress (PSS), insomnia (ISI) and suicidality (MADRS-S). The psychometric analysis supported using the proposed items over rival candidate items. The proposed weekly battery performed preliminary well in a small feasibility testing.\nConclusions: The battery of very brief disorder-specific scales is a feasible measurement for weekly monitoring of individual treatment progress and should be further examined in a larger sample.\n"

However, workplaces lack an overview of these, and stakeholders experience trouble finding materials that match their needs. Thus, a transverse, cross-sectoral effort was initiated, bridging the health and employment sectors in a national partnership commenced in order to pool knowledge and experience, to create an overview of the existing knowledge and tools within the field of mental health in the workplace, and to prepare and disseminate clear and common advice to Danish workplaces.\n\nLed by the Danish Ministry of Health (MoH), a partnership has been established between 35 partners, ranging both employee and employer organizations from the private and public sector and participants from patient organizations and the private sector. The partnership – called ‘Sammen om mental Sundhed’ has launched a shared toolbox at www.mentalsundhed.dk, bridging partners' professional knowledge in a science-based Q&A, lending support to the various roles at the individual workplace. More than 400 relevant tools, provided by partners, were tagged, sorted, and linked to the science-based Q&A, providing inspiration for possible actions to undertake.\n\nA representative survey conducted on behalf of the partnership has shown that one year after the digital toolbox was launched 5 percent of people in Denmark already knew about the effort (equivalent to 136,500 employees). 92 percent of these state that they have found helpful information at www.mentalsundhed.dk. Material from the partnership's joint national campaign, especially aimed at colleagues, was shown more than 7 million times, and seen by more than one in four Danes. From 2018 and forth the partnership has achieved permanent government funding has been allocated to meet the partners’ and governmental wishes for the continual operation of the partnership.\n\nThe transverse, cross-sectoral partnership constitutes a professional cooperation on mental health, bridging the health and employment sector, and mobilizing a broad interface to the larger part of the Danish workforce.

We found support for the concept, but the classification algorithm functioned as a black box, and needs to be evaluated, examined and optimized.\n\nMethods\nThose 199 patients who were classified, but whose treatment was not altered, will be used to assess the classifier as a whole as well as the 25 separate inputs (predictors) that yielded the classification. The classifier has an automated step (14 predictors) and a clinician-rating step (9 predictors) that will be examined separately to see if the cost of having clinicians rate patients if worth the predictive power. Predictors will be examined both as continuous using multiple regression and as package-classifiers using ROC-analysis and confusion matrix statistics.\n\nResults\nFor example, 23 % of patients where incorrectly classified as not-at-risk of failure (failed despite predicted to succeed) whereas 36 % where incorrectly classified as at-risk or failure (succeeded despite predicted to fail).

This can be done on patient mobile-phones and can be accessed from a secure webpage. Patient data on self-reported outcomes goes directly into a database and can be accessed as a daily, weekly, or monthly overview in the beginning of each therapy session by therapists. Data is also accessible during the week by the patients themselves. Therapist and patients are in this way able to follow and track clinically significant changes in relevant variables.\nBetween sessions patients can access short podcasts teaching 30 different Emotion regulation skills and access other psychoeducative material. \nThe mDiary RCT trial compares self-registration by paper to self-registration by mobile-phone at 4 different psychiatric treatment units specializing in borderline personality disorder and treating patients with dialectical behaviour therapy. \nThe trial protocol and first background data on the patients enrolled in the study will be presented.\nPatient time series data are collected during therapy while the patients are in psychiatric treatment.

Of these, 37,2% (N=363) were familiar with iDI, 29.6% (N=319) reported using some form of information technology (IT) to deliver care in the past and 61.7% (N= 787) considers using it in the future. Phone calls (23.8%), SMS (16.1%) and e-mail (16.2%) services were the most used, while guided (1.3%) and unguided (1.5%) internet-delivered structured programs were the least used. 8.7% (N=94) of psychologists reported using videoconference in the past. Considering the advantages of iDI, accessibility (79.9%), convenience (45.7%) and cost-effectiveness (45.5%) were considered the most important. Conversely, ethical concerns (40.7%), patient’s IT illiteracy (43.2%) and negative attitudes towards iDI (37%) were appointed as the main limitations. According to respondents, the main challenges to overcome in the implementation of iDI are related to limitations in the implementation of self-help techniques (62.8%), lack of evidence on the efficacy of iDI (62.2%), the adaptation of treatment protocols (61.7%), patient’s IT illiteracy (47.9%) and low adherence both from patients (43.3%) and psychologists (40.6) towards such programs. Finally, respondents showed greater acceptability towards blended-interventions (62.9%) (the combination of face-to-face and internet sessions within the same treatment protocol) compared to standalone iDI (18.6%).\nConclusions: This study is a contribute to the limited literature on the use and attitudes of Portuguese Psychologists towards iDI. A positive but guarded stance towards iDI was captured in this research. Portuguese Psychologists showed greater acceptability towards blended-interventions compared to standalone iDI."

    "Title": "Evaluation of a Brief Avatar-Guided ACT-based Intervention for Chronic Pain Management",
    "Abstract": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is an empirically supported intervention for the management of Chronic Pain. Increasing demands for cost reduction in healthcare services in addition to obstacles regarding physical access to treatment, highlight the need for innovative, cost-reducing, digital self-management interventions. Low adherence, nonetheless, is a significant challenge often faced in digital interventions, which may impact treatment effectiveness and result in high dropout rates (Kelders et al., 2012). Very few digital interventions appear to be planned for adherence a-priori, when designing an intervention. In addition, there is a lack of brief digital interventions with minimum human contact, in the field of CP. The main purpose of this study was twofold: 1) to design an adherence focused, brief, Avatar-led intervention for CP management and evaluate its effectiveness, and 2) conduct an in-depth analysis to assess adherence, user engagement, satisfaction with treatment and their relation to socio-demographic characteristics and treatment outcomes. Sixty-four participants were randomly allocated to an intervention group (ALGEApp) or an active control group (relaxation techniques). Both groups significantly contributed to improvements in the short-term on primary treatment outcomes of pain daily interference, quality of life, secondary treatment outcomes of mood and process outcomes of acceptance and psychological flexibility. However, ALGEApp demonstrated improvements in acceptance to a greater extent than the control. Satisfactory adherence and completion rates favored the ALGEApp group. A comparison between completers and non-completers showed that users with high-pain interference at baseline were more likely to drop out early from the study. Users who adhered moderately to highly to the intervention were more likely to improve on pain interference. In terms of metrics, performance in mini quizzes with feedback appeared to predict higher scores in pain acceptance at post-treatment. Overall, the brief Avatar-led ACT-based intervention was well accepted by sufferers. Findings shed light on the potential of brief and innovative, planned-for-adherence digital interventions, on reaching and engaging users who may not have easy access to treatment, while providing a set of skills to help them manage their pain through a home-based self-care approach.

They were trained to provide up to 15 min weekly motivational, emotional and technical support via phone or chat and are supervised by a clinical psychologist. \nThe story is based on behavioral activation, stress management and social support techniques. SbS was pilot tested and culturally adapted to the local context. The project attempts to address the high burden of disease associated with depression symptoms through a potentially cost-effective, scalable and evidence-based programme.\n\nObjectives: The objective of this feasibility RCT is to test the research methods and recruitment procedures in order to inform the large-scale definitive trial that will follow. We will provide a general overview of the outcome data, the recruitment and retention methods used and discuss lessons learnt.\n\nMethods: Participants are recruited through social media platforms and other outreach methods. If they screen positive for depression symptoms online, they will be randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group. Those in the control arm will receive basic psychoeducation and a list of existing primary health care centres with integrated mental health services. The intervention group will be granted access to the 5-session program along with minimal guidance from a team of well-trained lay helpers. \n\nResults: Initially, N= 60 participants from the Syrian, Lebanese and other nationalities living in Lebanon were intended to be recruited. Following the social media recruitment campaign, N = 128 participants were randomized in control (n = 70) and intervention (n = 58) condition. Results from the feasibility trial will be presented, along with experiences and lessons learned pertaining to the recruitment and retention of participants, with special focus on the refugee population.\n\nConclusion: This information will be used to improve the procedures for the definitive RCT in Lebanon.

    "Title": "Feasibility of smartphone apps as add-ons to regular treatment of suicidal patients",
    "Abstract": "Study objectives\nSuicidal behaviour remains difficult to predict and prevent. Clinical guidelines recommend that health care professionals develop a safety plan in collaboration with their suicidal patients to lower the imminent risk of suicidal behaviour. With evolving technology, mobile health applications (apps) provide new opportunities for safety planning and enable daily self-monitoring of suicide-related symptoms that may enhance safety planning. The CASPAR study applies a two-fold design to assess mobile safety planning and daily mobile self-monitoring as add-ons to regular treatment of suicidal patients. The first part of the study is practice-based research and evaluates the feasibility (i.e. usability, satisfaction and uptake) of mobile safety planning and daily self-monitoring in routine care treatment for suicidal patients. The second part analyses the monitoring data, in order to 1) validate previously postulated suicide-related psychological processes; 2) identify individual pathways to suicidal behaviour; and 3) profile types of suicidal individuals.\n\nMethods and material\nThe study is an adaptive single cohort design among 80 adult patients in treatment, suffering from recurrent depressive disorder or dysthymia, with an elevated risk of suicide. Patients are instructed to use their mobile safety plan when necessary and to monitor mental health variables, including suicide ideation, four times a day. Both apps are used in treatment. Because clinicians are using the apps as add-ons to regular treatment, we developed a comprehensive training in which clinicians learn how to develop a mobile safety plan and in what way self-monitoring can be used in treatment. During the study both patients and clinicians evaluate the apps.\n\nResults\nAt the conference, preliminary results are presented concerning feasibility of using apps as add-ons to regular treatment of suicidal patients. \n\nConclusion\nThe results from this study will gain insight into the feasibility of mobile safety planning and self-monitoring in treatment of suicidal patients. Furthermore, we provide further understanding of psychological processes of suicidal patients, especially regarding the transition from suicidal ideation to behaviour. This project is funded by ZonMW (the Netherlands) and is currently in ongoing.  "

    "Title": "Internet-based training for adults with ADHD: A pilot study\n",
    "Abstract": "Background:\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects individuals across the whole lifespan. The main treatment option of ADHD is pharmacological. Due to issues with pharmacotherapy such as unwanted side effects, intolerance to and lack of adherence to medication, adults with ADHD demand non-pharmacological treatment options. The demand for evidence-based psychological interventions is high, but its availability is poor. We have therefore, based on a co-design effort from health researchers, IT-researchers and end-users, developed an intervention program for adults with ADHD. Our aim is to improve access to and the efficiency of psychological interventions for adults living with ADHD\n\nObjective: \nTo test the feasibility of the first three of six training modules of the Internet based intervention by conducting a small-scale test of the methods and procedures and assess the acceptability, deliverability and within participant clinical outcomes. A secondary aim is to evaluate the usability of the intervention. \nMethods: The study has an uncontrolled, within group, pre-post design with an embedded qualitative and quantitative process evaluation. Ten participants with a self-reported ADHD diagnosis will receive an Internet-based intervention that focuses on stress reduction and improved ability of focused attention in daily life. The primary outcomes are reports of inattention and hyperactivity on the Adult ADHD Rating Scale (ASRS), quality of life as reported on the Adult ADHD Quality of Life and stress as measured with Perceived Stress Scale. Participants’ involvement, satisfaction and subjective evaluation of the treatment will also be assessed. \n\nResults: \nThe pilot study will be carried out from April 2019 to June 2019. Results from the pilot study will be presented at the ESRII conference. \n\nDiscussion: The strengths of the study is that the development of the intervention is a co-design effort with health researchers, IT-researchers and end-users. \n"

    "Title": "Guided CBT-based internet intervention (iSOMA) for multiple somatic symptoms: study design and feasibility of a RCT in university students ",
    "Abstract": "Medically unexplained symptoms and somatoform disorders are surprisingly prevalent among university students. At the same time, individuals rarely access traditional psychosocial support. Thus, internet-based and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) may be promising, low-threshold instruments. However, studies using IMIs in polysymptomatic (somatoform) conditions somatic are missing. This study investigates the feasibility and efficacy of a newly developed transdiagnostic CBT-based online intervention (iSOMA) in a sample of German speaking university students with multiple somatic symptoms as part of the European health platform “StudiCare”. In a two-armed RCT, the intervention group (IG) receives the eight-week training with weekly written therapist feedback (guided). After a waiting period of eight weeks, the waitlist control group (WLCG) receives iSOMA with guidance on demand. Eligible are students with a PHQ-15 score of ≥ 4. iSOMA consists of seven text-, audio- and video-based consecutive modules, as well as optional text messages (SMS-coach). Data collection (self-report) takes place at baseline (t0) and 8 (t1) and 16 weeks (t2) after randomization. Clinical outcomes include somatic symptom burden, psychological comorbidities, functioning and attitudes towards psychotherapy. Feasibility is mainly determined by intervention satisfaction and adherence. The trial started in august 2018, the target sample size is N = 154.  Current baseline data of n = 61 participants (83.6% female, 25.34 years (SD = 6.27) indicate a moderate somatic symptom burden (PHQ-15; M = 11.20, SD = 3.74) with average symptom duration of 3.26 years (SD = 3.89). 60.7% reported daily use of medication. The most common self-reported diagnoses were mental (31.3%), musculoskeletal (23%) and neurological disorders (21.3%). One fourth (22.9%) reported being in parallel psychosocial care. In the CEQ, 62.3% expected that iSOMA could be able to improve well-being. 17 out of 27 participants (63%) completed at least half of the training sessions. Of those, 78.6% were \"largely\" or \"very satisfied\" with iSOMA (CSQ-I). Reasons for dropout included lack of time and additional distress during the intervention. Current results indicate the feasibility and acceptability of iSOMA among students with multiple somatic symptoms. Further analyses on the efficacy, its moderators (e.g. therapeutic alliance) and subgroup analyses providing information on the differential indication are planned."

    "Title": "CORE: Usability and acceptance of a self-applied online protocol for the prevention of emotional disorders and promotion of resilience in university students: opinion of users and clinic psychologists.",
    "Abstract": "Introduction: There is now empirical evidence on the efficacy of online interventions for emotional disturbance and a high drop-out rate has been observed when online programmes are self-applied. In view of this, there are few studies on the causes of abandonment and the mechanisms to be implemented to increase acceptance and adherence to treatment by users in this type of intervention. The objective of this paper was to obtain data about the acceptance and usability of the CORE: Cultivating Our Resilience program, which tests the effectiveness and efficiency of self-administered training over the Internet for the promotion of resilience, coping skills and coping strategies in university students. \nMethodology: 5 students and 3 clinical psychologists participated, who completed 6-week training program, as well as 1 dropout. All responded to an online questionnaire to evaluate the degree of usability of the system and acceptability of the program, as well as open-ended questions to improve the program. \nResults: CORE was well accepted and valued by both university students and professionals who completed the training suggesting technical aspects of system improvement. Participants who left the intervention found the program technically basic and unattractive, and suggested the need for a more interactive therapist or guide, which was also suggested by some students who completed the program and an expert.\nDiscussion: The results indicate that it is possible to increase the acceptance and adherence to self-administered treatments, the next step is to evaluate the results of the monitoring and the moment of abandonment of the droputs for future studies.\n"

    "Abstract": "Introduction: University life is a process of new challenges and stressors. The data show a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety at this stage of life. In addition, training to improve psychological skills significantly decreases the chances of developing emotional problems. Therefore, it is important to develop interventions that specifically target students and strengthen resilient environments and communities. Online interventions are tools that offer us advantages to improve these skills and especially to reach this population. CORE, is a program based on Ryff's wellness model, whose goal is to test the effectiveness and efficiency of a self-administered Internet program for promoting resilience, coping skills and coping strategies in Spanish-speaking college students. So the purpose of this presentation is to show the CORE training protocol: cultivating your resilience applied to university students from Spain, Argentina and Mexico.\nMethodology: The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT), involving 324 university students assigned to three conditions: 1) CORE, 6-week training program and 2) HLP, a 6-week training to promote healthy lifestyle; and 2) Waiting list, who will receive training at 6 months . The primary evaluation measure is the Connor-Davidson resilience scale. Secondary measures were also included to evaluate anxiety, depression, quality of life, socioeconomic etc. Students will be evaluated at 4 weeks, 8 weeks post treatment and 6 months as follow-up for the analysis of results.\nDiscussion: The results of this study will contribute to research on Internet-administered treatments and the implementation of an effective treatment to prevent mental disorders in at-risk populations, especially to improve resilience and coping skills, decreasing symptoms of depression and anxiety, increasing psychological well-being for Spanish-speaking university students. In addition, avenues will be opened for new research on the effectiveness of these interventions focused on prevention and promotion of mental health in Spanish-speaking countries.\n"

    "Title": "Moodbuster 2.0 - Collaborative research platform for Internet interventions",
    "Abstract": "Moodbuster is a Web research platform to empower therapists in the development and evaluation of new Internet interventions. The platform currently encompasses 6 modules, in the scope cognitive behavioural therapy, that can be applied in self-help, blended or remotely assisted contexts. Each therapeutic module takes form through sets of therapeutic pages that are composed by text, media and exercises. New and alternative therapeutic approaches are constantly appearing, thus, creating and evolving the therapeutic modules requirements. The platform results from the combined effort of developers, researchers and therapists, across nearly a decade of collaboration. The Web platform includes two main portals: the Patient portal, that allows participants to go through a therapy and the Therapist portal allows therapist to assess the participants evolution. The task of implementing new modules is traditionally dependent on software developers, which conditions the development of new interventions by domain specialists in mental health research.In order to overcome this challenge the Intervention Builder (iBuilder) portal was designed and created. The newly created portal focuses mainly in facilitating collaborative research projects, by allowing researchers to create new therapeutic modules with minimal technical intervention. Since most of this collaborative research is cross-country, the platform is multilingual, thus incorporating the translator’s role. Using the iBuilder a researcher is able to create therapeutic content using a set of building blocks that include text, media, lists, several types of inputs, instruments and calendars. Content can be then organized in modules and further aggregated in treatments, that can be translated inside the platform prior to treatment delivery. iBuilder building blocks can be linked with each other allowing researchers to compose therapies with intra and inter module logic. The Therapist and Patient portals kept all the current functionalities but were redesigned to handle the dynamically generated treatments. Moodbuster 2.0 is a collaborative research platform that allows researchers to create and deliver new and personalized Internet Interventions."

    "Abstract": "Background\nWe conducted a longitudinal study examining the feasibility of using a smartphone app (‘ExPRESS’) to gather weekly reports of early signs of relapse, basic symptoms and psychotic symptoms over a six month period. Since this study had a longer follow-up period than any other study reporting a symptom monitoring app in established psychosis, participants’ app engagement, and predictors of this engagement, are of key interest.\n\nMethods\nIndividuals who had experienced a relapse of psychosis within the past year (n=18) were assessed at baseline using measures of psychotic symptoms, general symptoms, fear of relapse, substance use, medication adherence and demographics. Participants were then asked to use the ExPRESS app weekly for six months to answer questions about a personalized set of early signs of relapse, basic symptoms and psychotic symptoms. Participants received phone calls from the researcher (weekly for four weeks; monthly thereafter) to encourage participation and troubleshoot any difficulties with app use. \n\nThe pattern of app completion during follow-up was explored in a mixed-effects model with a random effect of participant and a fixed-effect of time. Effects of baseline variables on percentage app completion were examined using Spearman’s correlations (continuous variables), Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests (categorical variables). \n\nResults\nParticipants completed 65% of weekly app assessments, with 78% of the sample completing at least a third of assessments. Participants responded to fewer prompts as the study progressed (OR=0.89 per week follow-up, p<0.001). Percentage app completion was significantly and inversely correlated with baseline depression (ρ=-0.56, p=0.015) and fear of relapse (ρ=-0.58, p=0.014), with anxiety approaching significance (ρ=-0.48, p=0.052) and all other baseline variables non-significant.\n\nDiscussion\nPredictors of app engagement have been examined previously but a consistent picture is yet to emerge. Studies have variously reported that higher positive, negative or agitation/mania symptoms predicted lower app engagement, whereas the current study found a significant effect of depression and fear of relapse.

    "Title": "ExPRESS-ing my symptoms: service user experiences of using a symptom monitoring app for six months",
    "Abstract": "Introduction: Relapse of schizophrenia is common, has profound, adverse consequences for service users and is costly to health services. Early signs interventions aim to use warning signs of deterioration to prevent full relapse. ExPRESS is a smartphone app which monitors early signs of relapse and psychotic symptoms on a weekly basis. There is evidence that people with schizophrenia find apps an acceptable means for self-monitoring in the short term (1 week). However this is the first study to gather in-depth qualitative data from a sample using an app to monitor early signs of relapse in the long term (6 months).\n\nMethods: Individuals (n=18) experiencing a relapse of schizophrenia within the past year were asked to use ExPRESS weekly for 6 months to answer questions on their experience of early signs and psychotic symptoms. Face-to-face qualitative interviews (n=16) were then conducted to explore participants’ experiences of using the app. The topic guide sought participants’ views on the following a-priori themes: item content, layout and wording; the way the app looked; length and frequency of assessments; possible worries about using the app; how app usage fitted with participants’ routines; the app’s extra features; other experiences of using the app. Interview transcripts were analysed using the framework method which allows both a-priori and emergent themes to be examined.\n\nResults: Interview participants had a mean age of 38 (age range 22 to 57 years). Overall their responses to a-priori topics indicated that the app was acceptable. Participants suggested small changes that could be made for future versions of the app. The following emergent themes gave further insight into individuals’ experiences of using the app: accessibility and connection, barriers to app use, response style, self-reflection, therapeutic value.\n\nDiscussion: This study suggests that apps are an acceptable means of long-term symptom monitoring for service users with a diagnosis of schizophrenia across a wide age range. Some reported finding the app more accessible than visits from a clinician, since assessments were more frequent, more anonymous and did not require the individual to explain their feelings in their own words. Nevertheless, some barriers to using the app were reported. Despite the app containing no overtly therapeutic components, some participants found that answering weekly questions on the app prompted self-reflection which had therapeutic value for them. "

    "Title": "Utilising mixed methods to better understand App engagement.",
    "Abstract": "Background: Numerous mobile Apps are being developed for the self-management of mental health conditions. While user engagement for such digital interventions is often reported to be low, this claim needs to be reconciled with wider uncertainties of how best to even define and measure user engagement as a construct. The EMPOWER feasibility study (ISRCTN99559262) is a clinician led and peer worker supported trial of an App designed to identify early warning signs of relapse in psychosis and provide self-management support. EMPOWER is currently being tested in a multisite clinical trial. \nMethod: Due to the multifaceted structure of many digital interventions, an interdisciplinary approach is recommended to develop a shared understanding of how best to conceptualise user engagement. A parallel qualitative process evaluation is being conducted alongside the trial which foregrounds the subjective experience of how participants have experienced the EMPOWER intervention, using their own words. Utilising the free to use open source programming language R, a custom, locally stored and secure analytics platform has been built by the EMPOWER team which enables efficient management of both quantitative App usage data (including number of responses to self-monitoring prompts and time of response) alongside key themes constructed from qualitative interviews with participants. \nResults: This presentation will describe a small series of case studies which through triangulating quantitative and qualitative data have highlighted a number of key user engagement complexities which may also have implications for intervention acceptability and feasibility. For example, a participant with a very high level of overall App usage reported that for continued engagement they would prefer to be able to choose when to input daily self-monitoring data rather than waiting for a pseudorandomised prompt. \nConclusions: Exploring these complex relationships between quantitative usage and subjective user experiences across a range of participants appears pertinent to more fully interpret and understand why and when people choose to (dis)engage with digital interventions, and also what constructs might underpin user engagement as a phenomenon. \n"

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), the deliberate, self-inflicted destruction of body tissue without suicidal intent and for purposes not socially sanctioned, is an increasing health care problem in Denmark. Approximately 20 % of Danish adolescents report a history of NSSI at some point in their live. Individuals with NSSI have an increased risk of suicidality. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop and investigate the effectiveness of a low-cost app in reducing self-harming behavior. Aim: To investigate whether the effectiveness of the Zero Self-Harm app is superior to treatment as usual (TAU, i.e. care, information and attention at the ED, potential referrals and other actions depending on the degree of NSSI, but no specific treatment of the nature of the NSSI) in reducing 1) frequency of NSSI-episodes and 2) suicide ideation, hopelessness, depressive symptoms and eating disorder symptoms in individuals with NSSI. Methods/design: The trial is designed as a 2-arm, parallel group, 6 months, randomized clinical superiority trial. A total of 256 participants, 128 in each arm, will be included. One group will receive TAU, the other will receive the app. Participants will be recruited from the somatic and psychiatric ED in the Capital Region of Denmark, when discharged with recent acts of NSSI without further planned treatment. Inclusion criteria: Engagement in two or more episodes of NSSI in the past month, no further planned treatment, have a smartphone, fluent in Danish, provide an informed written consent, age ≥ 15 years. Primary outcome is the mean monthly difference in frequency of NSSI-episodes at 6-month. The trial is planned to start in June 2018. Analysis and results are expected in December 2020. "

    "Abstract": "Context: A vast body of research has established the efficacy of online interventions in treating depression and anxiety. Despite this, attrition from treatment remains a problem associated with internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) programs, the reasons for which are poorly understood. The current literature lacks in-depth studies of the subjective reasons for and patient experiences of online treatment drop-out. \n\nMethods: The present study is a nested semi-structured interview exploring the subjective experiences of drop-out from iCBT within a larger RCT on online treatments for depression (Richards et al., 2018).  The iCBT intervention was offered to patients as step 2 level treatment in the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) stepped-care model. The interviews were conducted with 15 patients who had dropped-out of the iCBT intervention and, therefore, did not complete all the modules. An initial literature review of existing attrition research produced four broad domains of investigation around which the interview was structured: Technology, Motivation, Content and Support. The interviews will be qualitatively analysed using the Descriptive-Interpretive method where these four domains will be explored (Elliott & Timulak, 2005).\n\nResults: Data analysis for this study is ongoing and will be presented at ESRII 2019.\n\nConclusion: The current study seeks to understand the patient’s subjective experience of dropping-out from an iCBT intervention in step 2 IAPT, explore what could have helped adherence and establish what type of patient is most suited to iCBT. The results of this study will supplement the existing literature relating to treatment attrition.\n"

    "Title": "Measurement Invariance Analysis of an Instrument Assessing Implementation Success of Complex Interventions Across Healthcare Settings",
    "Abstract": "Context. The implementation of research evidence into practice is a challenging process, especially when interventions are complex and have multiple interacting components, i.e. internet interventions. Implementation science aims at facilitating this step, however, the field is lacking valid instrumentation to assess mechanisms underlying implementation. The 20-item Normalization MeAsurement Development tool (short NoMAD), based on the Normalization Process Theory, measures Normalization as an indicator for implementation success. The pragmatic NoMAD instrument seems to be an applicable instrument in the fast-changing world of Internet interventions. The questionnaire is validated in different settings with good internal consistency (α = .89 and .87). We aimed at testing the NoMAD for measurement invariance (MI) across translations to provide a sensible instrument which can be administered in different languages across implementation contexts. \nMethods. This study is based on the studies of Finch et al. (2018) and Vis et al. (2019), which validated the NoMAD in an English and a Dutch version. The total sample consisted of 694 participants from the UK, Australia and The Netherlands. Among others, implemented interventions focusing on mental health care services including eHealth interventions. A MI analysis was performed to investigate whether the instrument does measure the same concepts across translations. \nResults. MI can reach different levels of strictness, that is configural invariance, metric, and/or scalar invariance. The main analysis of the NoMAD data showed that the 20 items of the instrument are partially metric invariant. However, when exploring the instrument further and deleting two previously weak identified items (ca.2 and rm.1) from the item scale, the level of MI increased and the 18-item NoMAD showed full metric invariance, as well as partial scalar invariance. \nDiscussion. Based on the described results, we suggest the NoMAD as reliable and generally applicable across translations and implementation settings. We recommend to further discuss the final composition of the item scale and potentially delete the items which were identified weak across several analyses. However, more data is needed to strengthen this argument. In this talk, I will give examples on how the NoMAD can be used to understand and facilitate the implementation of internet interventions across several settings."

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Physical activity is a potentially effective treatment for depression and depressive relapse. However, promoting physical activity in people with depression is challenging. eMotion is a Web-based intervention combining behavioural activation and physical activity promotion for people in the community with symptoms of depression. The objectives were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering eMotion to people in the community with symptoms of depression and to explore outcomes.\n\nMethods: People with elevated depressive symptoms were recruited from the community and randomised to eMotion or a waiting list control group for 8 weeks. eMotion is a web-based, modular intervention that supports people to use key behaviour change techniques to re-engage in routine, pleasurable, and necessary activities, with a focus on physical activities. Feasibility data were collected as well as data for the primary (depression) and secondary outcomes (e.g. physical activity) at baseline and 2 months post-randomisation using self-reported web-based questionnaires and wrist-worn accelerometers. Delivery fidelity (e.g. logins, modules accessed, time spent) was tracked using web-usage statistics. Exploratory analyses were conducted on the primary and secondary outcomes. \n\nResults/Findings: 62 participants were recruited. The mean baseline score was 14.6 (SD 3.2) on the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8). 52 participants provided accelerometer-recorded physical activity data at baseline showing a median of 35.8 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.0-98.6) minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recorded in at least 10-minute bouts per week. The median number of logins, modules accessed, and total minutes spent on eMotion was 3 (IQR 2.0-8.0), 3 (IQR 2.0-5.0), and 41.3 (IQR 18.9-90.4), respectively. Acceptability was mixed. Exploratory data analysis showed that PHQ-8 levels were lower for the intervention group than the control group at 2 months post randomisation (adjusted mean difference −3.6, 95% CI −6.1 to −1.1). \n\nConclusion: It was feasible to deliver a web-based intervention combining behavioural activation and physical activity to inactive populations. Subject to some minor refinements, eMotion is now ready for testing in a full-scale trial."

Binge eating occurs at least once a week and is associated with marked distress. The level of severity depends on the number of binge eating episodes per week.\nBED is the most common eating disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1.4-2.0%. It was included as a diagnosis in DSM-5, but is not yet recognized as an eating disorder in the WHO diagnostic manual used in Denmark.\nThe Danish treatment options are insufficient to meet the needs of about 50.000 Danes who are estimated to be affected by BED.\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown good effect in the treatment of BED, but yet no Danish CBT-interventions exist in mental health care settings.\nCan digital solutions be an option to establish evidence-based, accessible, feasible and effective treatment for BED?\n\nAim: The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate the effect of an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program for BED called i-BED.\n\nParticipants: Patients can refer themselves for treatment online from May 1st 2019.

    "Title": "Digital Interventions in Service Provision: a descriptive-interpretive qualitative approach to examining stakeholders experiences of implementing digital interventions.",
    "Abstract": "Background: The efficacy and effectiveness of internet-delivered interventions (IDIs) has already been established across numerous conditions and contexts, and a number of services have implemented them into their treatment-as-usual package. However, the juvenile nature of the field of digital interventions means that the implementation procedures, strategies and contextual influences are not widely or coherently documented. A number of individuals from different groups are often involved in the implementation of digital interventions, and a concerted effort is typically required to ensure these interventions are sustained within treatment-as-usual. Further, most studies publish implementation data associated with research implementations with finite lifespans and learnings that are difficult to translate to routine service. Therefore, the current study sought to establish the current practice of implementing digital interventions into routine practice from the experience of those involved in the development of the interventions (the digital healthcare industry) and healthcare providers. \n\nMethods: The research utilised a series case study design, guided by the descriptive and interpretive methodology (Elliot & Timulak, 2005; Timulak & Elliot, 2019) to qualitatively analyse stakeholder experience of implementing digital interventions in mental healthcare service provision. A qualitative approach was favoured over traditional survey-based methods as it would allow for the researchers to extract a detailed account of the implementation phenomenon. A semi-structured interview schedule was developed around 4 main domains; implementation process, implementation strategies, contextual influencers and decisive elements. Stakeholders involved in the implementation process from the digital intervention industry (product developers, customer success managers and sales people) and healthcare organisations (clinicians, service managers and policy makers/informers) were invited to participate. \n\nResults: Data is currently in the process of being analysed and will be presented at ESRII 2019. \n\nConclusions: The current research seeks to establish expert experience of implementing digital interventions in service provision. This research forms part of a larger project that aims to develop an evidence and practice informed model of implementation for digital interventions. \n"

    "Title": "How durable is the effect of iCBT for depression and anxiety? Remission and relapse in a longitudinal study",
    "Abstract": "Context: With Depression and Anxiety disorder’s global prevalence rates varying between 4.7% and 10.2% for males and females and co-morbidity rates being found to be as high as 50%, greater chronicity, slower recovery and increased rates of recurrence are unfortunately a consequence. Various biological and psycho-therapeutic interventions (e.g. antidepressants and CBT) have been used to treat these disorders and their maintenance effects. However, less is known about the long-term effect (i.e. the durability) of internet-delivered interventions for such presentations. Therefore, this study investigates relapse and remission rates following the completion of iCBT interventions for anxiety and depressive symptoms, delivered within a stepped-care approach.\n\nMethods: A good enough level (GEL) model of improvement assessed SilverCloud Health’s iCBT programmes for individual’s experiencing low to moderate levels of depressive and/or anxiety symptoms, with weekly support provided by Psychological Well-being Practitioners (PWPs) throughout the intervention phase. Relapse and remission rates were assessed through participant self-completion of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 at 3, 6, 9- and 12-month follow-up. Participants were included until the 12-month follow-up assessment apart from instances were relapse occurred or participants failing to respond to two consecutive follow-up assessments.\n\nResults: The project is currently ongoing - the preliminary results of the analysis will be presented at ESRII 2019.\n\nConclusion: The current research seeks to quantify post-treatment relapse rates at 3, 6, 9- and 12-months’ follow-up, to explore predictors of time-to-relapse and hence identify the durable effect of iCBT for low to moderate depressive and anxiety symptoms within a stepped-care approach.\n"

    "Abstract": "Vincent van Gogh, Edward Much, Sylvia Plath, Frida Kahlo. All artists who not only had mental health conditions, but who expertly communicated their suffering through their paintings and writings. \nThey all lived in a time when online therapy was not even in the horizon. Nowadays, we now are lucky to have this technology at our disposal, however are also struggling to keep pace as researchers, but also as human beings. We still refer to art and literature to find meaning in what we feel, and often use it as an escape from the fast-paced world we inhabit. \nMoreover, some of the themes that existed back in the times of these artists remain: stigma and coping with mental disease, as well as a struggle to define what common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety are, how to classify them etc. \nThis talk will attempt to link these themes, using some of the artists’ works and quoting from their writings. The goal of the talk is to get us thinking more about the deeper meaning of what we do, to not get lost in the innovation, important as it may be, without appreciating the history and beauty of the representation of mental illness. Certainly then, we may discover we can be as passionate with our research as Van Gogh was with a paintbrush and Plath was with a pen. \n"

    "Title": "Online therapist-guided CBT for gambling disorder within regular addiction care: Protocols for a pilot trial and a three-armed randomized superiority and non-inferiority trial",
    "Abstract": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a recommended treatment for gambling disorder (GD), a disorder characterized by compulsive, excessive gambling with negative consequences. Established CBT manuals are often derived – without full tailoring to the unique mechanisms and presentation of GD – from treatment manuals for other addictions, and most have not been adequately updated to match societal changes in gambling patterns. Further, in Sweden, access to qualified CBT for GD is overall limited, with large regional differences, which internet interventions could help to remedy. We have developed a novel CBT treatment for GD, informed by recent research on gambling topography and function, featuring tailored behavioral exercises aimed at training control and broadening the behavioral repertoire. This treatment will be offered as an online, 10-module, therapist-guided program by the Stockholm Addiction eClinic, to all regular GD patients enrolled in addiction care in Stockholm. To our knowledge, this is one of the first internet interventions for GD to be fully implemented and integrated into regular addiction care. Recruitment to a non-randomized pilot trial (n=24) will begin in spring 2019. During treatment, participants will provide weekly measures of self-rated GD symptoms and gambling (outcome measures), as well as well-being, sense of control, gambling-related cognitions, and cravings (possible mediators). Outcomes will be examined using mixed effects models. Preliminary results are expected to be available at time of full presentation. A larger, three-armed randomized controlled trial (n=50+50+50) comparing the same intervention to natural healthcare waiting-list (superiority hypothesis; 1:2 arm ratio), and after natural waiting-list to treatment-as-usual (non-inferiority hypothesis) is scheduled for late autumn 2019. This trial will also examine mediation using structural equation modeling. The results of these two studies will have important implications for CBT treatment of GD, as well as the implementation of internet interventions within regular addiction care."

    "Title": "Internet-Delivered Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy for Anxiety and Depression: CBT Skills Usage and its Role in Maintaining Outcomes",
    "Abstract": "Introduction: Internet-delivered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (iCBT) has previously been found to effectively treat anxiety and depression. However, gaps in the literature remain around the long-term effectiveness of iCBT and mechanisms of change involved. Aims: The study aimed to further support the long-term effectiveness of iCBT for anxiety and depression by exploring how effects are maintained into follow-up. One potential mediator of iCBT follow-up outcomes, the use of CBT-related skills post-treatment was explored. CBT-related skills usage was hypothesised to predict maintenance of iCBT outcomes at follow-up. Method: Nested within a large pragmatic Randomised Controlled Trial, study participants completed measures of anxiety, depression and functioning before and after receiving 8-weeks of clinician-supported iCBT, and at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-up. Mixed methods were used to assess CBT skills usage throughout follow-up. Results: Preliminary analysis suggested moderate to large improvements in anxiety, depression and functioning from pre-treatment to post-treatment, which were maintained at follow-up. Descriptive and interpretive analysis revealed participants’ use of a wide range of CBT skills and associated helpful and hindering experiences. Preliminary analyses revealed a positive relationship between CBT skills usage and the maintenance of functional improvements at follow-up. Longitudinal mediation analysis to explore the effect of CBT skills usage on the maintenance of iCBT outcomes is being conducted. Discussion: Findings are situated within the iCBT and wider CBT skills usage literature. Strengths and limitations of the study are discussed and opportunities for future research and clinical application described. Conclusion: While further research is needed to address limitations of the current study, its real value lies in the hypotheses it has helped to generate within an underresearched area."

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Depression is highly prevalent and often accompanied by comorbid anxiety disorder. However, comorbidities are often not treated. Transdiagnostic tailored internet- and mobile-based interventions might be promising to overcome such issues. \nAim: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a transdiagnostic tailored internet intervention for depression and comorbid anxiety in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). \nMethod: Two-hundred participants with MDD will be randomly assigned to an 8-week guided self-help internet intervention (IC) or a 6-month wait-list control group (WLC). The transdiagnostic tailored internet intervention is comprised of seven sessions plus one booster session including psychoeducation, behavioral activation, exposure, and problem solving. Participants of the IC will receive weekly content-focused feedback on module completion as well as monitored adherence reminders from an eCoach. The primary outcome is clinician-rated depression severity (QIDS-C) at post-assessment assessed by diagnostic raters blind to study condition. Secondary outcomes include, e.g., change in diagnostic status (MDD and anxiety disorders), remission and response rates, disorder symptom severity, health related quality of life, incongruence related to needs and values, and behavioral activation. Assessments will take place at baseline and post-assessment, 6-month follow-up, and in the IC 12-month follow-up. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. \nResults: The 8-week efficacy will be presented. Results are still pending. Until now, 188 out of 200 participants were randomized to the study conditions. \nDiscussion: The present study will provide evidence on the efficacy of a transdiagnostic tailored guided internet- and mobile-based treatment protocol. \n"

    "Abstract": "Effective, accessible, and affordable depression treatment is of high importance. In ‘blended depression treatment’, online and face-to-face interventions are integrated into one treatment protocol, reducing the number of face-to-face sessions. The E-COMPARED project examined the clinical effectiveness of ‘blended depression treatment’ compared to treatment as usual (TAU) on symptoms of depression in people with major depression in 9 European countries. The main hypothesis was that blended cognitive behavioral treatment for major adult depression (bCBT) would be clinically non-inferior (not less effective) but cost-effective when compared to TAU. \nMethods: a multi-site, two-arm, randomized non-inferiority clinical trial with a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside was performed in 9 European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, UK, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland). The main inclusion criterion was Major Depressive Disorder as assessed with the M.I.N.I. diagnostic interview. The RCTs were conducted in routine primary and specialized mental health care settings. Blended depression treatment consisted of individual face-to-face CBT and CBT delivered through an Internet-based treatment platform. Duration of the treatment, number of sessions, and platform differed per country (Moodbuster in Netherlands, UK, Germany, France, Poland; Smiling is fun in Spain; Deprexis in Switzerland; Iterapi in Sweden; NoDep in Denmark) as well as treatment-as-usual (Face-to-face psychotherapy in Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, UK, Poland, France; treatment by the GP in Spain, Sweden, Germany). \nResults: We will present the results on the clinical effectiveness at twelve months follow-up (depression symptoms and diagnostic interview for depression). 835 participants were included in the analyses. Overall bCBT showed to be non-inferior to TAU at 3, 6 , and 12 months. However, results were dependent on setting (primary versus specialized mental health care) and country. \nConclusion: Blended depression treatment seems a good alternative to treatment as usual in primary and specialized mental health care. We currently further develop the Moodbuster platform supported by another European project (eMen) focused on the implementation and upscaling of eMental health."

    "Abstract": "Background: People living with cancer and their caregivers are confronted with a multitude of challenges, including navigating a complex health care system, going through treatments and side effects, and managing physical as well as psychological symptoms. Mobile health applications (MHAs) have the potential to support patients and caregivers throughout the cancer trajectory. Owing to the rapidly growing number of MHAs and their unrestricted availability, it is difficult to evaluate their quality and safety for users. The present study systematically reviews content, quality and practical relevance of MHAs for cancer available in German app stores.\n\nMethods: A systematic review of available MHAs addressing people living with cancer and their caregivers is being conducted in the German Google Play and iTunes Store. MHAs will be extracted using a web crawler and selected according to pre-defined in- and exclusion criteria. Quality of apps will be rated independently by two trained researchers using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). The MARS is a multidimensional tool assessing quality of apps on the four subscales engagement, functionality, aesthetics and information quality. Apps will further be classified according to target group (patients, informal caregivers, health care providers), application area (prevention, treatment, aftercare), content (e.g. information provision, symptom tracking, behavioural change) and safety.\n\nResults: Searches in both app stores have been completed, quality ratings are in progress and final results will be presented at the conference.\n\nDiscussion: This systematic review will contribute to the scarce knowledge about availability, content and quality of mobile applications specifically addressing the needs of people living with cancer and their caregivers. Results will be integrated into the mobile health app database (MHAD; http://www.mhad.science/) to make them transparent and available to patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. Further insights from the MHAD project will be given. Opportunities and risks of MHAs will be discussed.\n"

    "Abstract": "In the current digital society, every aspect of our lives is being affected by the digitalization of data. To address complex questions arising from the further development and use of digital technologies, the Association of Universities in the Netherlands (VSNU) has initiated the Digital society program, bringing together over 30 leading professors in their respective fields. The key objectives are 1) putting societal needs central to further research about digitalization processes, 2) promote responsible human-centered digitalization, and 3) collaborate closely with stakeholders.\n\nTo meet these objectives, all Dutch universities collaborate across disciplinary boundaries. The aim is to develop a shared research agenda and engage with a broad range of societal partners to create research that puts societal needs central. This should accelerate the processes of digitalization and the promotion of responsible, human-centered digitalization and datafication. Seven program lines are set up to bundle research activities and accomplish this common goal. In the ‘Health & Well-being’ program line, eight universities work together to develop, evaluate and implement integrated and personalized digital healthcare solutions, while understanding the societal challenges raised by this digitalization. \n\nWith this program, we hope to increase inter- and multi-disciplinary university positions, attention for digitalization and data science, methodological repertoires in all disciplines and the number of co-authored and co-referenced publications amongst participating researchers. Further, we hope to provoke higher quality public and political debate, increase social experimentation, and improve digital literacy in Dutch society. Finally, the program leads to more inter- and multi-disciplinary project collaborations and productive public-private partnerships.\n"

As part of a broader investigation into adherence in the lung diseases asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), the aim of the current systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness of a broad range of e-health interventions on improving adherence to medication and exercise in patients with COPD. \nMethod: A systematic literature search was conducted in the databases of Cochrane library, PsychINFO, PubMed, and Embase, in order to identify randomized controlled trials conducted in adult COPD populations. The risk of bias of included studies was examined with seven items of the Cochrance Collaboration’s Risk of Bias tool. \nResults: 9 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which four studies investigated focused on medication adherence and five studies focused on exercise adherence. In all studies, the effect on clinical outcomes were also investigated as a separate outcome measure. There were many differences between the included studies with respect to, for example, the type of intervention and the operationalization of adherence or clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, significant positive effects as well as no effects were found for medication adherence as well as exercise adherence. Furthermore, some positive clinical effects were also found, although not exclusively in the studies that reported positive effects on the medication or exercise adherence. \nDiscussion: The use of e-health adherence interventions in COPD seems promising for improving medication and exercise adherence and could possibly also have positive effects on clinical outcomes, but its efficacy might be influenced by many factors such as the operationalization of outcome measures and type of intervention."

    "Abstract": "Background: International studies have shown that college students are an at risk population for the development of mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. However, little is known about the prevalence rates of mental health conditions in college students, especially from non-US samples. Moreover, despite the fact that Internet-based interventions for depression and anxiety have been found to be effective in adult populations, these have less often been tested in college students. \n\nMethod: The Caring Universities project is embedded within the WHO World Mental Health International College Student (WMH-ICS) surveys. It combines epidemiological with effectiveness research. All first year students at two Dutch universities were invited to complete an online survey with validated instruments assessing a variety of mental health conditions, once in 2018 and again in 2019. Subsequently, those with increased symptoms of depression were invited to participate in a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT). Therein, a transdiagnostic individually tailored Internet-based intervention for depression and anxiety was compared to a control group receiving care-as-usual (CAU) group. The primary outcomes of the RCT were the PHQ-9 and GAD-7. \n\nResults: During the conference, the data of the first participant cohort will be presented. 562 participants completed the WMH-ICS survey in 2018. Until the moment of this submission, 90 of these completed the 2nd round in 2019. Moreover, the preliminary results of the post-intervention assessment of the 41 participants randomized into the trial will be presented. \n\nDiscussion: The Caring Universities project aims at filling the gap in information on prevalence rates of mental health conditions in non-US college student samples. Moreover, to our knowledge this is the first attempt at providing an Internet-based intervention as a result of such a screening instrument. Implications for research and practice will be discussed. \n"

This study is part of a model project by a German social insurance company (SVLFG) for implementing internet- and tele-based preventive services. This study aims to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a personalized tele-based preventive service in reducing depressive symptom severity and preventing depression in people in green professions. \n\nMethods. In a two-armed randomized controlled trial (N=312) with follow-ups at post-treatment (6 month), 12-, and 18- month entrepreneurs in green professions, their collaborating family members and working pensionaries with elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 5) are randomly allocated to an intervention group (tele-based coaching) or enhanced treatment as usual (psychoeducation and routine care information). The primary outcome of the study will be depressive symptom severity (QIDS-SR16). Secondary outcomes include quality of life (AQoL-8D) and perceived stress (PSS-10). \n\nIntervention: Participants in the intervention group will receive up to 20 personalized telephone-delivered sessions (25-50 minutes) over a 6-month period from a psychologist with further therapeutic training. The tele-based coaching will be enriched by referrals to on-site coaching or social and health services (e.g. socioeconomic counseling for farmers), respectively, if needed.\n\nResults. Recruitment is ongoing since December 2019. Preliminary results on secondary outcomes at post-treatment will be presented at the conference.\n\nConclusions. This study is the first nationwide RCT evaluating the effectiveness of a tele-based preventive service tailored to the needs of green professions. The analysis of the secondary outcomes will give a first hint on the effectiveness of the intervention. In the long term, implementation of tele-based coaching as preventive care could lead to reductions in disease burden and health care costs.\n"

    "Abstract": "An E-Health Application for Suicidal Prevention\n\nAbstract—E-health applications have the potential to let the patient access and follow their mental and physical conditions. E-health applications can also provide feedback to patients and help them to change their behavior. This project work on a mobile application (app in short) for suicide prevention. The aim of this poster is to describe the architectural solution and the major challenges and barriers during the process of programming.\nIt is our ambition to develop not only an electronic health (e-health) approach but also an intelligent health (i-health) paradigm. The principle is to develop a self-help tool on an A.I platform with a supporting avatar used by the patient to manage their health status. The use of a powerful A.I tool at home has the potential to overcome well-known limitations as stigma and geographical problems in a clinical context. However, developing an efficient e-health app is challenging, especially for sensible topics such as suicide prevention. The application must be developed carefully (data protection, user-involvement, question choice) in order to increase its acceptance by the patients. But it is also challenging regarding programming issues and the data architecture is crucial.\n\nThe original Myplan will be used as backbone and the new app will allow patients to collect passive (geographical movement, sleep pattern and so on) and active data (questionnaires and self reported data) about their health status. The data will be flashed on a dashboard, which will give the patient the data-control and the empowerment. The data will also be collected by an A.I server, which will build a personal algorithm. The goal is to let the supporting avatar pop up every time there is a fluctuations in the relevant patterns. And at the same time let the avatar learn what the fluctuations means and what the patient prefer as coping strategies by interviewing the patient.\n\nAfter a while the avatar should be trained enough to predict the patients behaviors and start pushing the preferred coping strategies to the patient before the fluctuations takes place. In that way the project hope to help the patient in time before a personal crisis occurs."
